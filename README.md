# Life-game
This is the python program for the Conway's Game of Life, a classic example of cellular automata. The principle of this game is trying to show that a set of very simple rules can create an extremely complex world, which is also the assertion of emergence approach in philosophy.

You can input the parameters about the scale of lattice and evolving steps. During the evolution, the rules are just as follows: If there are too many (>3) or few (<2) cells around a specific cell, then this cell will die. If there are 2 cells around, the central cell keep its original status. And if there are exactly 3 cells around, the central cell will be created to simulate reproduction. Only these very simple and natural rules can give you visual feasts.

What's more, the game of life has much more meanings in computing science because it is computationally irreducible. This fact tells us unless we stare at the evolution process to the end, there is no algorithm can be used to determine what is the final state according to the initial state. It furtherly tell us our real world maybe also computationally irreducible. Due to its enough complexity, the game of life is Turing complete, which means that you can finish all the computational tasks that can be approached by any computers just by this little game. The most magic thing is you can even simulation another game of life in a original game of life and iterate this process to infinity.
